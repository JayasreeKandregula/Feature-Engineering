# Feature-Engineering

Handling missing values in the data set - Caused due to technical errors, privacy concerns, human errors.

We know that machine learning algorithms use some input data to produce results. But quite often, the data you’ve been given might not be enough for designing a good machine learning model. That’s where the power of feature engineering comes into play.

Goals:

Preparing the proper input dataset, compatible with the machine learning algorithm requirements

Improving the performance of machine learning models
